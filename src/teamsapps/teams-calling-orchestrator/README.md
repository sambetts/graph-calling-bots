# Teams Calling Orchestrator

This app is to start a call for everyone within a Team where the app is installed, by tag. This is good for war-room type teams where you need calls quickly automated. 

## Debugging Solution

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the command bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Set up your dev environment for extending Teams apps across Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-m365-apps-prerequisites)
> Please note that after you enrolled your developer tenant in Office 365 Target Release, it may take couple days for the enrollment to take effect.
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug (Edge)` or `Debug (Chrome)`.
4. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.

## Configuring Solution
The Teams app relies on the [Group Calling Bots - Azure Functions App](https://github.com/sambetts/graph-calling-bots/blob/main/src/examples/Group/GroupCallingBotFunctionsApp/README.md) project running, either locally or in a real Azure functions app.

If you want to override the default localhost value for the bot API endpoint, search for ``BOT_ENDPOINT`` environment variable and change accordingly.

| - | - |
| `.vscode`    | VSCode files for debugging                          |
| `appPackage` | Templates for the Teams application manifest        |
| `env`        | Environment files                                   |

The following are Teams Toolkit specific project files. You can [visit a complete guide on Github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-Visual-Studio-Code-v5-Guide#overview) to understand how Teams Toolkit works.

| File                                 | Contents                                           |

|`teamsapp.yml`|This is the main Teams Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things:  Properties and configuration Stage definitions.|
|`teamsapp.local.yml`|This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging.|
|`aad.manifest.json`|This file defines the configuration of Azure Active Directory app. This template will only provision [single tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps#who-can-sign-in-to-your-app) Azure Active Directory app.|
